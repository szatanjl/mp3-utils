Note: If you are wondering where are ID3v2.0 and ID3v2.1 standards then
stop.  Those do not exist.  In fact standard ID3v2.2 also doesn't exist.
Wait what?!  At first there was standard ID3v2.  Just v2, not v2.0 etc.
ID3v2 header contains version number.  It was set to $02.  It did not
stand for ID3v2.*2* but for ID3v*2*.  With introduction of the next
ID3v2 standard header's version number was incremented to $03, but
instead of calling it ID3v*3* it was named ID3v2.*3* and so from now on
the header version number stands for the sencond number in the name.
Because of this version ID3v2 started being called ID3v2.2 to preserve
symmetry.
