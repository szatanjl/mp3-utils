                      ID3v2 Accessibility Addendum

Status of this document

   This document is a proposed addendum to the [ID3v2.3] and [ID3v2.4]
   standards. Distribution of this document is unlimited.

Abstract

   This document describes extensions which make ID3v2 metadata
   accessible to the visually impaired. The approach may also be useful
   for audio players which have limited display capabilities. A new
   frame type is proposed that carries an audio clip which can provide
   a verbal expression of the textual information carried by another
   ID3v2 frame.

2. Conventions in this document

   Text within "" is a text string exactly as it appears in a tag.
   Numbers preceded with $ are hexadecimal and numbers preceded with %
   are binary. $xx is used to indicate a byte with unknown content. %x
   is used to indicate a bit with unknown content. The most significant
   bit (MSB) of a byte is called 'bit 7' and the least significant bit
   (LSB) is called 'bit 0'.

   A tag is the whole tag described the ID3v2 main structure document
   [2]. A frame is a block of information in the tag. The tag consists
   of a header, frames and optional padding. A field is a piece of
   information; one value, a string etc. A numeric string is a string
   that consists of the characters "0123456789" only.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119].

3. Introduction

   The ID3v2 standards provide a way to deliver metadata that is
   predominantly human-readable, textual data. However, in this form the
   information is not easily accessible to the visually impaired.

   The purpose of this Addendum is to allow content providers or
   third-party tools to provide an audio description (i.e. a spoken
   narrative) that is equivalent to the textual information carried by
   an ID3v2 frame. A new "audio-text" frame is defined which carries an
   audio clip and a matching equivalent text string. These text strings
   can be compared against the strings carried by other ID3v2 frames to
   identify when a matching audio description is available.

   The audio clips can be played whenever the equivalent textual
   information is displayed or highlighted, providing a greatly improved
   user interface for the visually impaired. However, the feature may
   also be popular with other users and useful for media players with
   limited display capabilities.

4. Proposed audio-text frame

   The purpose of this frame is to carry a short audio clip which
   represents the information carried by another ID3v2 frame that is
   present in the same tag.

   To avoid these audio clips being confused with the main audio content
   of the file the ID3v2 unsynchronisation scheme must be used if the
   audio clip uses an MPEG audio format. If the unsynchronisation scheme
   is not appropriate for the audio format then the scrambling scheme
   defined in section 5 must be applied to the audio clip data.

     <ID3v2.3 or ID3v2.4 frame header, ID: "ATXT">
     Text encoding   $xx
     MIME type       <text string> $00
     Flags           %0000000a
     Equivalent text <text string according to encoding> $00 (00)
     Audio data      <binary data>

   The Frame ID for the audio-text frame shall be set to "ATXT" using
   ISO-8859-1 character encoding.

   The MIME type shall be represented as a terminated string encoded
   using ISO-8859-1 character encoding. Where the MIME type corresponds
   to MPEG 1/2 layer I, II and III, MPEG 2.5 or AAC audio the ID3v2
   unsynchronisation scheme should be applied, either to the audio-text
   frame or to the tag which contains it. For other MIME types the
   scrambling scheme defined in the Appendix should be applied to the
   audio data.

   Flag a - Scrambling flag

      This flag shall be set if the scrambling method defined in Section
      5 has been applied to the audio data, or not set if no scrambling
      has been applied.

      The Equivalent text field carries a null terminated string encoded
      according to the Text encoding byte as defined by the ID3v2
      specifications [1], [2]. This text must be semantically equivalent
      to the spoken narrative in the audio clip and should match the
      text and encoding used by another ID3v2 frame in the tag.

      The Audio data carries an audio clip which provides the audio
      description. The encoding of the audio data shall match the MIME
      type field and the data shall be scrambled if the scrambling flag
      is set.

      More than one audio-text frame may be present in a tag but each
      must carry a unique string in the Equivalent text field.

5. Scrambling scheme for non-MPEG audio formats

   This scrambling scheme is provided for non-MPEG audio formats where
   the unsynchronisation scheme defined by the ID3v2 specifications is
   unsuitable. Each bit of the audio data is scrambled by taking the
   exclusive-OR (XOR) between it and the equivalent bit of
   a pseudo-random byte sequence. The first byte of this pseudo-random
   byte sequence is always %11111110 and is used to scramble the first
   byte of the audio data. The next byte of the sequence is derived from
   the current byte of the sequence using the algorithm in Table 1 and
   is used to scramble the next byte of audio data. This process is
   repeated until all bytes in the audio clip have been scrambled.

                 Table 1: Scrambling sequence algorithm
                       byte N+1   byte N
                       bit 7 =    bit 6 XOR bit 5
                       bit 6 =    bit 5 XOR bit 4
                       bit 5 =    bit 4 XOR bit 3
                       bit 4 =    bit 3 XOR bit 2
                       bit 3 =    bit 2 XOR bit 1
                       bit 2 =    bit 1 XOR bit 0
                       bit 1 =    bit 7 XOR bit 5
                       bit 0 =    bit 6 XOR bit 4


   This algorithm results in a 127-bit pseudo-random sequence which
   repeats on byte boundaries every 127 bytes. To recover the audio data
   from the scrambled data the scrambling procedure is repeated.

6. Notes

   1. Failure to use the ID3v2 unsynchronisation scheme or the
      alternative scrambling scheme, as appropriate to the audio format,
      is very likely to confuse media players which are likely to start
      playback when an audio-text frame in encountered rather than at
      the end of the ID3v2 tag.
   2. Players which only support MPEG audio formats are not required to
      support the scrambling scheme provided for non-MPEG formats.
   3. It is not required to provide an audio-text frame to represent
      every text string present in a tag. The emphasis should be on text
      strings in frames that are commonly used to identify and describe
      the content (e.g "TIT2", "TALB" & "TPE1").
   4. A parser that does not recognise "ATXT" frames can skip them using
      the size field in the frame header.
   5. Editing text fields in ID3 tags may result in the retention of
      irrelevant ATXT frames and gaps in the provision of audio text
      unless action is taken to amend the corresponding ATXT frames.
