                    MP3 ID3 Tag Protocol Definition

Note: I do not 'own' nor want to own this tag format, its something
I created for myself that other people attached to.  In this regard,
this information is for free of use for other playlist makers who want
real info with their songs and a standard specification.  In other words
you do not have to ask me permission to use this information.  I believe
in freedom of information, in this way it promotes growth of other
quality playlist makers and continues to 'up' the anty for what
a playlist maker should have with every release from other great
playlist makers.
(Just remember ID3 was the first! =), even though it did suck!)
