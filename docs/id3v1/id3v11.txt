                       ID3-Tag Specification V1.1

   ID3-Tag Specification V1.1 (12 dec 1997) by Michael Mutschler
   <amiga2@info2.rus.uni-stuttgart.de>, edited for space and clarity
   reasons.


Overview

   The ID3-Tag is an information field for MPEG Layer 3 audio files.
   Since a standalone MP3 doesn't provide a method of storing other
   information than those directly needed for replay reasons, the
   ID3-tag was invented by Eric Kemp in 1996.

   A revision from ID3v1 to ID3v1.1 was made by Michael Mutschler to
   support track number information is described below.


ID3v1 Implementation

   The Information is stored in the last 128 bytes of an MP3. The Tag
   has got the following fields, and the offsets given here, are from
   0-127.

     Field      Length    Offsets
     Tag        3           0-2
     Songname   30          3-32
     Artist     30         33-62
     Album      30         63-92
     Year       4          93-96
     Comment    30         97-126
     Genre      1           127

   bytes.

Track addition - ID3v1.1

   In ID3v1.1, Michael Mutschler revised the specification of the
   comment field in order to implement the track number. The new format
   of the comment field is a 28 character string followed by a mandatory
   null ($00) character and the original album tracknumber stored as an
   unsigned byte-size integer. In such cases where the 29th byte is not
   the null character or when the 30th is a null character, the
   tracknumber is to be considered undefined.
