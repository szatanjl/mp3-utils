                 ID3 TAG and Enhanced TAG specification

What is a ID3 TAG:

In short - it's an information which is located at the end of an MP3
file and contains: artist name, song name, album name, year of
releasing, music genre and a comment.  Detailed information below.


Why we made Enhanced TAG:

* longer strings: It's clear - 30 bytes in normal TAG aren't enough.  In
  lot of genres like rock, pop, instrumental, vocal etc. you have enough
  place in 99% of songnames & artists, but even 30 bytes for album name
  can be not enough.  But if you like dance / house / trance / techno
  / drum'n'bass / etc. you don't have enough place.  Don't you believe
  me?  So look at some of your dance CDs - and you'll be in.  Artists
  are usually DJs, there is still someone 'featuring'.  And with the
  songnames it isn't better - even if you have a short songname there
  can be name of the remix, name of remixer, and so on

for example:
Depeche Mode - Barrel Of A Gun (United Nine Inch One Punch Mix)
               ^                            ^                 ^
               1                            30                48   53!
               *                            *                 *    *
        Moby - All That I Need Is To Be Loved - Hard Trance Version
  Diana Ross - Take Me Higher (Reverend Jefferson's Mash 'Em Up Mix)

David Morales & The Bad Yard Club feat. Crystal Waters and Delta - In The Ghetto
^                            ^                                 ^
1                            30                                64!

So this is clear I hope.

* speed: Now the speed - this is useful when you're in some mood.  If
  you're sad, or you just go to bed - you will propably prefer slow
  relax music.  If you have some party at home maybe you want to play
  some fast pieces.  And let's say your stuck somewhere in code and
  angry of endless debugging - maybe some ultrafast hardcore will make
  your adrenalin go away.  In this situations genres aren't enough - you
  can have slow or fast rock, pop, drum'n'bass, house, etc.  Now I know
  you understand this feature too.

* genre: in this point, you're absolutely free.  If your player/playlist
  maker doesn't support some genre and you definite must/want to have it
  filled as accurately as possible - you have a problem.  Actually - you
  HAD a problem.  Now you can type anything you want (30 characters).

* start & end time: not yet supported by players, but be sure it will
  be.  This was made because we are sick of some downloaded MP3 files.
  Sometimes there is a noisy flick or burst in the beginning of the
  file, sometimes there is needless long silence at the end.  Player
  capable to handle this will save your time and nerves. Maybe there
  will be option to fade-in in the start (it's not good to start in the
  noisy part).

* comment: wasn't enlarged.  We suppose currently used 30 bytes to be enough.


How does the 'Enhanced TAG' work?

Well the credo was 'As compatible as possible'.  That's why the 'TAG+'
is in the front of 'TAG'. 'TAG+' writes to 'TAG' and if it overflows
(the name/artist/album is too long to fit into 'TAG' space) then it
writes to its own place.  So this mean that first 30 bytes are always in
'TAG' and players/playlist makers which support 'TAG' are able to read
it without any problems.  It's like long file names in Win95 - Windows
read everything - in DOS you don't have all but still have enough to be
oriented.  Genre2, speed, start & end time are always stored in 'TAG+'
roo.  'TAG+' not supporting programs will ignore them.  In this solution
you still have only one editbox for name, artist and album.
