                         What is Lyrics3 v2.00?

The Lyrics3 v2.00 tag is more complicated than the previous Lyrics3 tag
but has a lot more capabilities. Just like the old Lyrics3 tag it
resides between the audio and the ID3 tag, which must be present. The
tag uses only text for everything from content to size descriptors,
which are represented as numerical strings. This makes it easier to
implement a Lyrics3 v2.00 reader.

The Lyrics3 block, after the MP3 audio and before the ID3 tag, begins
with the word "LYRICSBEGIN" after which a number of field records
follows. The Lyrics3 block ends with a six character size descriptor and
the string "LYRICS200". The size value includes the "LYRICSBEGIN"
string, but does not include the 6 character size descriptor and the
trailing "LYRICS200" string.

Lyrics3 v2.00 uses fields to represent information. The data in a field
can consist of ASCII characters in the range 01 to 254 according to the
standard. As the ASCII character map is only defined from 00 to 128
ISO-8859-1 might be assumed. Numerical fields are 5 or 6 characters
long, depending on location, and are padded with zeroes.

Only the size of the tag sets the limit for how many fields may be
present. All fields uses a simple structure that includes a three
character field ID, six characters describing the size of the
information and the actual information. This makes it possible to read
unknown fields and write them back when saving the tag. There are no
required fields in the tag, but at least one field must exist. Fields
can appear in any order in the tag, except the indication (IND) field
which must be the first field if used. Fields that include more then one
line uses [CR][LF] delimiters between lines.

* Defined fields

The following list is a list of currently defined field IDs. More fields
might be added if needed on newer versions of the Lyrics3 v2.00
specifications. Unknown fields should be ignored.

ID    Max size   Description
IND   00003      Indications field. This is always three (3) characters
                 big in v2.00, but might be bigger in a future standard.
                 The first byte indicates wether or not a lyrics field
                 is present. "1" for present and "0" for otherwise. The
                 second character indicates if there is a timestamp in
                 the lyrics. Again "1" for yes and "0" for no. The third
                 character inhibits tracks for random selection - "1" if
                 inhibited and "0" if not.
LYR   99999      Lyrics multi line text. Timestamps can be used anywhere
                 in the text in any order. Timestamp format is [mm:ss]
                 (no spaces allowed in the timestamps).
INF   99999      Additional information multi line text.
AUT   00250      Lyrics/Music Author name.
EAL   00250      Extended Album name.
EAR   00250      Extended Artist name.
ETT   00250      Extended Track Title.
IMG   99999      Link to an image files (BMP or JPG format). Image lines
                 include filename, description and timestamp separated
                 by delimiter - two ASCII chars 124 ("||"). Description
                 and timestamp are optional, but if timestamp is used,
                 and there is no description, two delimiters ("||||")
                 should be used between the filename and the timestamp,
                 Multiple images are allowed by using a [CR][LF]
                 delimiter between each image line. No [CR][LF] is
                 needed after the last image line. Number of images is
                 not limited (except by the field size).

Filename can be in one of these formats:

- Filename only - when the image is located in the same path as the MP3
  file (preferred, since if you move the mp3 file this will still be
  correct)
- Relative Path + Filename - when the image is located in a subdirectory
  below the MP3 file (i.e. images\cover.jpg)
- Full path + Filename - when the image is located in a totally
  different path or drive. This will not work if the image is moved or
  drive letters has changed, and so should be avoided if possible (i.e. 
  c:\images\artist.jpg)

Description can be up to 250 chars long.

Timestamp must be formatted like the lyrics timestamp which is
"[mm:ss]".  If an image has a timestamp, then the visible image will
automatically switch to that image on the timestamp play time, just the
same as the selected lyrics line is switched based on timestamps.

The extended Album, Artist and Track are an extension to the fields in
the ID3v1 tag - which are limited to 30 chars. If these extended fields
exist, make sure their first 30 chars are exactly the same as the ones
in the ID3v1 tag. If they are the same, display the extended field. If
not, display the one from the ID tag. These 'mismatched' extended
fields, should be removed when saving the lyrics tag.

When saving the extended fields, make sure to copy the first 30 chars of
each field to the ID3 tag matching fields. It is recommended NOT to save
extended fields at all, if they are not larger then 30 chars.


* Example

The following includes all the information from after the mp3 data until
the ID tag. Please note that unless a [CR][LF] is at the end of the
line, no [CR] or [LF] should be added between lines.

- The indications field size is two bytes. They are two '1', which mean
  that LYR field is to be found in the tag, and timestamps are used in
  it.
- The extended Album text size is 41 chars The extended Artist name size
  is 50 chars
- The extended Track name size is 42 chars
- The Additional information size is 90 chars
- The Lyrics Author size is 48 chars
- The Image file link size is 86 chars
- The Lyrics text size is 630 chars

All the fields together (with the 'LYRICSBEGIN') is 001064 chars.

The ID3v1 tag that comes after this example should have:

- Album field: 'Album name that is larger then'
- Artist field: 'Artist name or band that is la'
- Title field: 'Track name which is larger the'

How to read a Lyrics 3 v2.00 tag Here is a step by step description of
how to read the lyrics3 v2.00 tag:

1. Read the 9 bytes before the ID3v1 tag, if any. Those 9 bytes must be
   LYRICS200.
2. Read the previous 6 bytes, which are text digits that, when
   interpreted as a number, give you the total number of bytes in the
   Lyrics3 v2.00 tag field, including the LYRICSBEGIN header, but not
   including the trailing Tag size and LYRICS200 end string.
3. Seek back in the file from the beginning of the tag size field, the
   number of bytes read in the previous step.
4. Read 11 bytes forward. These 11 bytes must read LYRICSBEGIN.
5. Start reading fields until you have read the number of bytes
   retrieved in step 2.

Here is a step by step description on how to read fields:

1. Read 3 chars, which are the field ID.
2. Read 5 characters as a number which contain the number of bytes of
   data for this field.
3. If you already read LSZ bytes including the 'LYRICSBEGIN' then stop
   reading fields. If not, go back to 1.

Note: If you happen to read a Field ID that is not listed in the
standard on this page, keep the information and be sure to write it back
to the MP3 file. Such fields may be included in future standards so the
data should be retained. Contact information
